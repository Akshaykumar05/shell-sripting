# shell-sripting
In this repo, we are learning and doing hands-on of shell (bash) scripting language.
```
mkdir myscript
```
```
cd myscript
```
* Now edit the file
```
vim 01_basic.sh
```
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello Buddy"
```
* Run the script using following commands:
```
bash 01_basic.sh
```

```
./01_basic.sh
```
Sometime it can show a permission issue, where we need to give the executable (x) permission to the file.
```
chmod +x -1_basic.sh
```
Again run the script, it should be working now.
